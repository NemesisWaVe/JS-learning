# JS-learning
Learning JS for the first time, my aim here is to make such a space, such that even if I forgot all my knowledge about this language. I will know where to reach and the place will be here. You guys can also refer to my repo cause I have given more specific comments in it for easier understanding, since I am a complete begineer dont expect much from me haha (p.s might be lil bit cringe file or folder creation but its just for fun :D). Also I will be editing this readme file everyday for the sake of myself and recoding my learning curve on a daywise basis.
DAY 1: Learnt how to create Git repo, basics about printing in JS also how variables work.
DAY 2: Stay tuned!!!
